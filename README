nicofetch.py - fetch videos from nicovideo.jp

Features include:

- Download videos - even without an account as long as the uploader
  has not disabled the external player feature
- Use your account if you have one - avoid economy mode if you have a
  premium account
- Download comments as XML
- Extract audio from videos (requires external tools)

Run the script with no arguments to see USAGE.

The script can also be used as a library to add nicovideo downloading
abilities to your own scripts, if anybody ever comes up with a use for
such a feature.

Future ideas:

- Don't download into a temporary file with a random path to make it
  easier to play the video as it downloads.
- Add an option to convert comments to a format a normal video player can
  use as an overlay to show comments on downloaded videos.
